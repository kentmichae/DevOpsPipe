While there isn't a universally agreed-upon set of "16 gates of DevSecOps," the term generally refers to integrating security practices into the DevOps process. DevSecOps emphasizes the importance of security throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Below are some key principles and practices often associated with DevSecOps:

Governance as Code: Implement policies and compliance measures as code, ensuring they are automatically enforced throughout the development process.

Continuous Security Monitoring: Incorporate automated security monitoring throughout the development lifecycle to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

Security Champions: Designate individuals within development and operations teams as security champions who focus on promoting and implementing security best practices.

Automated Compliance Checks: Integrate automated compliance checks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code adheres to security and regulatory requirements.

Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyze source code for security vulnerabilities before it is compiled or interpreted.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Test applications during runtime to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

Container Security Scanning: Scan container images for vulnerabilities and ensure that only secure and approved images are deployed.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security: Apply security practices to infrastructure code to ensure the security of the entire environment.

Secrets Management: Securely manage and store secrets, such as API keys and passwords, using dedicated tools.

Dependency Scanning: Identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.

Incident Response Automation: Develop automated incident response processes to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents.

Threat Modeling: Conduct threat modeling exercises to identify and mitigate potential security threats early in the development process.

Continuous Risk Assessment: Regularly assess and reassess security risks throughout the development lifecycle.

Security Training and Awareness: Provide ongoing security training and awareness programs for development and operations teams.

Security Automation and Orchestration: Automate security processes and orchestrate responses to security events.

Shift-Left Security: Integrate security practices earlier in the development process, catching vulnerabilities as early as possible.

These practices aim to embed security into the DevOps culture, fostering collaboration between development, operations, and security teams to deliver secure and resilient software. The specific implementation of DevSecOps may vary depending on organizational needs, industry requirements, and technology stacks.
